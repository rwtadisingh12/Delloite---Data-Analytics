# 📊 **Factory Device Unhealthiness Analysis - Tableau Dashboard**  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project is a **Tableau dashboard** that visualizes the **unhealthiness of factory devices** across different locations. The analysis helps in identifying devices that require maintenance and factories that have high unhealthiness levels.  

## 📌 **Key Features**  

✔ **Factory-Level Analysis:** Identifies factories with the highest device unhealthiness.  
✔ **Device-Type Breakdown:** Highlights which types of machines contribute most to inefficiencies.  
✔ **Interactive Visuals:** Built using **Tableau Desktop Public Edition** for effective data exploration.  
✔ **Data-Driven Insights:** Helps in decision-making for maintenance and operational efficiency.
